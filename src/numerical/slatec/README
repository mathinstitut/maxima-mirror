Numerical routines for use with Maxima.

These are routines converted from the original Fortran code from the
SLATEC library to Lisp via f2cl.  The Fortran code is stored in the
fortran directory.  (Some of the code may have been slightly modified
from the original code obtained from www.netlib.org, but the original
versions are stored in CVS.)

Here's how to regenerate the Lisp files from the Fortran files.  Do
this if f2cl has been updated in a relevant way or if the Fortran
files have been updated.  These instruction mostly assume that you
start at the root of the Maxima source tree.

1. Load defsystem.lisp.
2. Get f2cl from https://gitlab.common-lisp.net/f2cl/f2cl.
   1.  `(load "path/f2cl.system")`
   2.  `(mk:oos "f2cl" :compile)`
3. `(load "src/numerical/slatec/slatec.system")`
4. `(mk:oos "slatec" :compile)`

This should generate all the Lisp files and place them in
src/numerical/slatec/lisp.

Also, as of this writing, the converted files were done using CMUCL.
If some other Lisp is used, the formatting of the files may be totally
different.
